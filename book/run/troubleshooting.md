## Database

### Slow database inserts and updates

If you're:
1. Running behind the tip
2. Have slow canonical commit time according to the `Canonical Commit Latency time` chart on [Grafana dashboard](./observability.md#prometheus--grafana) (more than 2-3 seconds)
3. Seeing warnings in your logs such as 
   ```console
   2023-11-08T15:17:24.789731Z  WARN providers::db: Transaction insertion took too long block_number=18528075 tx_num=2150227643 hash=0xb7de1d6620efbdd3aa8547c47a0ff09a7fd3e48ba3fd2c53ce94c6683ed66e7c elapsed=6.793759034s
   ```

then most likely you're experiencing issues with the [database freelist](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/5228).
To confirm it, check if the values on the `Freelist` chart on [Grafana dashboard](./observability.md#prometheus--grafana)
is greater than 10M.

Currently, there are two main ways to fix this issue.


#### Compact the database
It will take around 5-6 hours and require **additional** disk space located on the same or different drive
equal to the [freshly synced node](../installation/installation.md#hardware-requirements).

1. Clone Reth
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
   cd reth
   ```
2. Build database debug tools
   ```bash
   make db-tools
   ```
3. Run compaction (this step will take 5-6 hours, depending on the I/O speed)
   ```bash
   ./db-tools/mdbx_copy -c $(reth db path) reth_compact.dat
   ```
4. Stop Reth
5. Backup original database
   ```bash
   mv $(reth db path)/mdbx.dat reth_old.dat
   ```
6. Move compacted database in place of the original database
   ```bash
   mv reth_compact.dat $(reth db path)/mdbx.dat
   ```
7. Start Reth
8. Confirm that the values on the `Freelist` chart is near zero and the values on the `Canonical Commit Latency time` chart
is less than 1 second.
9. Delete original database
   ```bash
   rm reth_old.dat
   ```

#### Re-sync from scratch
It will take the same time as initial sync.

1. Stop Reth
2. Drop the database using [`reth db drop`](../cli/reth/db/drop.md)
3. Start reth

### Database write error

If you encounter an irrecoverable database-related errors, in most of the cases it's related to the RAM/NVMe/SSD you use. For example:
```console
Error: A stage encountered an irrecoverable error.

Caused by:
   0: An internal database error occurred: Database write error code: -30796
   1: Database write error code: -30796
```

or

```console
Error: A stage encountered an irrecoverable error.

Caused by:
   0: An internal database error occurred: Database read error code: -30797
   1: Database read error code: -30797
```

1. Check your memory health: use [memtest86+](https://www.memtest.org/) or [memtester](https://linux.die.net/man/8/memtester). If your memory is faulty, it's better to resync the node on different hardware.
2. Check database integrity:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
    cd reth
    make db-tools
    ./db-tools/mdbx_chk $(reth db path)/mdbx.dat | tee mdbx_chk.log
    ```
    If `mdbx_chk` has detected any errors, please [open an issue](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues) and post the output from the `mdbx_chk.log` file.

### Concurrent database access error (using containers/Docker)

If you encounter an error while accessing the database from multiple processes and you are using multiple containers or a mix of host and container(s), it is possible the error is related to `PID` namespaces. You might see one of the following error messages.

```console
mdbx:0: panic: Assertion `osal_rdt_unlock() failed: err 1' failed.
```
or

```console
pthread_mutex_lock.c:438: __pthread_mutex_lock_full: Assertion `e != ESRCH || !robust' failed
```

If you are using Docker, a possible solution is to run all database-accessing containers with `--pid=host` flag.

For more information, check out the `Containers` section in the [libmdbx README](https://github.com/erthink/libmdbx#containers).
